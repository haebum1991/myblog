Implementing a typical login page can be quite complex in R shiny.
Implementing such a typical login page requires handling user information and passwords, 
which presents limitations when building it in R Shiny.
This post demonstrates how to create a "login page" in an R Shiny app.
More precisely, it might be more appropriate to call it a simulated login page.

For example, you could create a feature that takes guests 
from the login page to the main UI page by simply entering their email address.
Furthermore, you can even have your visitors receive a notification 
via email as soon as they enter their email address.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Please install these packages before import them.
# Load packages
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)
library(shinydashboard)
library(htmltools)
```

The following R Shiny code creates a simple login page UI. 
It allows users to input their email (required) and affiliation (optional) before clicking the "Go to app" button to proceed.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  shinyjs::useShinyjs(),  # Enables the use of ShinyJS for dynamic UI control
  
  ## UI login page
  div(
    id = "login_page",  # Wrapper div with an ID for the login page
    
    fluidRow(  # Creates a responsive row layout
      column(4,  # Defines a column that takes 4/12 of the width
             offset = 4,  # Centers the column by adding an offset of 4

             wellPanel(  # Creates a styled panel for login inputs
               class = "login-panel",  # Custom CSS class for styling
               
               h2("Welcome to Login Page!"),  # Heading text
               
               textInput(inputId = "subscribe_email", 
                         label = HTML('Email (<span style="color: red;">required</span>)'), 
                         value = ""),  # Required email input field with HTML formatting
               
               textInput(inputId = "subscribe_affil", 
                         label = "Affiliation (optional)", value = "")  # Optional affiliation input field
             ),
             
             column(12,  # Full-width column inside the main column for button alignment
                    style = "text-align: right;",  # Aligns the button to the right
                    actionButton(inputId = "login_btn", 
                                 label = "Go to app")  # Button to proceed to the main app
             )
      )
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {}
shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

After writing the code, you can run it using `shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`, 
and the login page UI will be displayed as follows.
(!Note that we haven't started the server part yet! So, there is nothing written in the server section. 
You can modify various elements to match your design. Try making some changes and experiment with different settings!)

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
cat('<iframe src="https://rumibam.shinyapps.io/2025-02-07-02-r-shiny-create-login-page/" 
      width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>')
```
