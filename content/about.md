Hello, and Welcome to my Blog!
I am a scientist who focus on the multifaceted study of air quality and atmospheric phenomena, 
including the analysis of wildfire smoke on ozone, air pollutant monitoring, and 
the utilization of satellite and remote sensing data to assess atmospheric parameters. 
I am also deeply engaged in studying the physicochemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, 
the dynamics of new particle formation (NPF), and 
the development of predictive models using machine learning.
